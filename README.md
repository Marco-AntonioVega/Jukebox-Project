# Jukebox-Project
This is the final project I completed for the Google-sponsored Computer Science Computing Inititative (CSSI). 
I collaborated with two other team members: Jeremiah Munguia and Jose-Diaz Trinidad.

We used the p5 javascript library to build a Jukebox Project that plays music that is accompanied by visuals
that reflect a certain song's frequencies.
The user can "activate" the jukebox by spending a coin. Then, they can choose from 9 different songs to play 
while the frequency visualizer works next to the jukebox. There is a functioning stop button, but the pause 
button is currently out of order.

If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.
